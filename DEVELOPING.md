## What's in the folder

## Get up and running straight away

* set breakpoints in the code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug the extension
* find output from the extension in the debug console

## Make changes

* you can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
* you can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with the extension to load the changes.

## Publish
