# Highlight Bad Chars

Extension to highlight bad characters such as No-break space ( ) and the Greek question mark (;) in your source files.

With this package you'll easily notice invisible and easy-to-confuse characters, which can be the cause for incredibly annoying syntax errors in source code.

Save yourself the burden of debugging invisible bugs for hours!

### Settings

Additional unicode characters can be specified in Visual Studio Code 'Settings'.
`highlight-bad-chars.additionalUnicodeChars` is the setting name array object that is used. To add additional unicode characters, add a new string array value with the unicode character to mark as shown in example below.

```json
    "highlight-bad-chars.additionalUnicodeChars": [
        "\u200E",
        "\u200F"
    ],
```

The default "bad char" decoration style can be configured through the
`highlight-bad-chars.badCharDecorationStyle` and defaults to:

```json
    "highlight-bad-chars.badCharDecorationStyle": {
        "cursor": "crosshair",
        "backgroundColor": "rgba(255,0,0,0.3)",
        "borderWidth": "1px",
        "borderStyle": "solid",
        "borderColor": "rgba(255,0,0,0.6)"
    }
```

The bad characters are also reported in the problem pane. By default, the severity is set to 'warning' (`1`) and you can configure it using `highlight-bad-chars.severity`. You can use 0 for error, 1 for warning, 2 for information and 3 for hint.
